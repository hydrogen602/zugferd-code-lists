# zugferd code lists

This project attempts to take the many code lists that are part of the ZUGFeRD specification and convert them into rust enums for use in other projects.

This project is in no way or form affiliated with the official ZUGFeRD project.

# Status

Currently ZUGFeRD 2.3.2 code lists are partially supported. See `py_generate/sheets.py` for what exactly is supported.
